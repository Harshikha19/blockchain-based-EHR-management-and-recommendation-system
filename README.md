# medical recommendation system with blockchain

The Blockchain based healthcare recommender system is a designed keeping in mind the needs of doctors and patients .The data is stored in a blockchain system to prevent tampering of the data.This Highly personal and confidential data should only be accessible to verified personnel and doctors.This makes the healthcare system more transparent and secure.

Considerations made while designing the overlay of the system .
1.The system should store the information of doctors and patients in different blocks.
2.The patients data like age and medical conditions can be stored in blockchain
3.On the basis of the symptoms described by the patient the disease can be predicted and the related diets ,medications and exercise can be recommended to the patient.
4.This recommendation data can also be stored in the blockchain under the particular patient data to maintain health care records and history of patients.

# Limitations of current model
1.The results of the recommendation system are in ideal conditions and give accuracy of 100 but when dataset is changed to a more robust dataset the accuracy might drop and in those scenarios there may be requirement of more powerful algorithms.
2.The current implementation of the model lacks in storing the recommendations in the blocks as per individual patients which can be delved deeper in future scope.
3.Current blockchain recommender system does not use a smart contract for storing transactions as of now the blockchain creation is done in python .The transactions can be made with help of smart contracts.
4.Currently we are running the blockchain system via postman.But a web Interface can be designed to make it more user friendly  and easy to use.
